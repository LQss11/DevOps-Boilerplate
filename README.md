# DevOps-Boilerplate
In this repo you will find a set of open source DevOps configurations and documentations on how I usually set them up on the envs I work on.
## Notice
In order to understand each you will find a `README.md` file in each one of them.

>I will usually be working with **docker** a lot so make sure you have it installed on your host machine If you want to follow through some steps.
